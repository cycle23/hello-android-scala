[Wiki Entry - Android Development](https://github.com/cycle23/cycle23.github.io/wiki/I.-Android-Development)

This is a generated app from the [Scala on Android Quickstart](http://scala-android.org/quickstart/), with some modifications needed to get it working just right from my dev environment, including ensuring it compiles with JDK 1.7 instead of 1.8.

In progress now on changes to support [Google VR Android SDK](https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-android-sdk), directly using `sbt`.
